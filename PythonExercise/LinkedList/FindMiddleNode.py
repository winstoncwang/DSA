# Implement the find_middle_node method for the LinkedList class.
# Note: this LinkedList implementation does not have a length member variable.
# If the linked list has an even number of nodes, return the first node of the second half of the list.
# Keep in mind the following requirements:
# The method should use a two-pointer approach, where one pointer (slow) moves one node at a time and the other pointer (fast) moves two nodes at a time.
# When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list or has no next node, the slow pointer should be at the middle node of the list.
# The method should return the middle node or the first node of the second half of the list if the list has an even number of nodes.
# The method should only traverse the linked list once.  In other words, you can only use one loop.
